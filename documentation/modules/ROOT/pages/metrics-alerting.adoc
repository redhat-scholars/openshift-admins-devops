## Custom Application Metrics and Alerting

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management[Application
Performance Management (APM)] "is the monitoring and management of
performance and availability of software applications". Software monitoring
has been around for a very long time, and there are myriad tools that all
implement it differently, from host-level agents to language-specific
libraries and more.

OpenShift includes a
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/monitoring/cluster_monitoring/about-cluster-monitoring.html[Prometheus-based
monitoring stack] out of the box that is automatically integrated and
configured to monitor the health of the OpenShift cluster itself. This system
can be easily extended to
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/monitoring/monitoring-your-own-services.html[enable
end-users to configure their own application monitoring and alerting], too.
The beauty of enabling the built-in monitoring for end-user applications is
that standard Kubernetes objects, via YAML/JSON, are used for the
configuration of the monitors and alerts. This means that your
development/application teams can treat the monitoring of their applications
like a part of the application code, and version, develop, and test their
performance monitoring and alerting as part of the standard SDLC.

### Enable End-User Application Monitoring
End-user application monitoring is not enabled by default in OpenShift. It is a simple process to turn it on.

1. Visit the OpenShift web console
2. Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges
3. Make sure to select the _Administrator_ perspective in the upper left
4. Click _Workloads_ and then _Config Maps_
5. Click _Create Config Map_
6. Paste the following YAML into the box:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    techPreviewUserWorkload:
      enabled: true
----

7. Click _Create_

Once you create the `ConfigMap`, the OpenShift Monitoring operator sees it
and will spring into action. The operator will create a `Project` to hold the
user workload monitoring components, and then deploy them.

1. Select the _Developer_ perspective in the upper left
2. Click _Topology_
3. In the _Project_ dropdown, choose `openshift-user-workload-monitoring`

You will see that, in a few moments, a Prometheus operator, a Prometheus
`StatefulSet`, and a link:https://thanos.io/[Thanos] `StatefulSet` will be
deployed. These components are what will process the Monitoring and Alerting
rules that your end-users will create.

### Allow Users to Create Monitors and Alerts
Even though users can create `Projects` by default, and even though those users inherit the `admin` role for their `Projects`, they don't automatically have RBAC permissions to create Monitors or Alerts. Since you are interacting with your cluster as a user with `cluster-admin`, you wouldn't notice these permissions issues.

How can you solve this? 

The documentation shows how to grant the correct permissions using the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/monitoring/monitoring-your-own-services.html#granting-user-permissions-using-web-console_monitoring-your-own-services[web
console] as well as using the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/monitoring/monitoring-your-own-services.html#granting-user-permissions-using-cli_monitoring-your-own-services[command-line
interface]. Doing this for each user individually and for all `Projects` is
the worst choice and will involve the most effort. Don't do that. It's good
for testing. It's bad for the real world.

The best and most ideal way is to make it automatic for the end user and to
not have to intervene all the time.

Rule No. 1: Don't make things hard for your end users.

When a user creates a `Project`, there is actually a behind-the-scenes
request process that is taking place. You can learn more about this process
and how to modify it in link:#[this exercise]. To automate giving users the ability
to create Monitors and Alerts, you would want to create a `RoleBinding` that
grants the `monitoring-edit` role as a part of that project request process.

When you have a large number of users and those users may be collaborating in
a single OpenShift `Project`, it can become tricky with respect to managing
these permissions. Ideally you would do this with group membership that is
informed by some kind of hierarchy that exists in your identity management
system. The specific details of implementing such a thing are outside of the
scope of this exercise.

Back to the task at hand: Since you are currently logged in as a user with
the `cluster-admin` role, you already have the permissions you need to
manipulate monitors and alerts. Therefore, you don't have to do anything
extra before continuing with this exercise. Just keep the permissions
requirements in mind when you build out your cluster for your users.

### Deploy an Example Application
Now that your cluster is configured to be able to monitor end-user
applications, and your users have permissions to create Monitors and Alerts,
you can try monitoring an application to see what it looks like.

1. In the web console, choose the _Developer_ perspective at the top left.
2. Click the _Project_ dropdown and then _Create Project_
3. Call your project _metrical_. You can give it a display name or a
description if you wish.
4. Click _Create_
+
At this point, you can now deploy the sample application. The view you're
immediately presented after creating your `Project` is the deployment
workflow.
+
If for some reason you have navigated away, click _+Add_ on the left first.
5. Click _Container Image_
6. Where it says _Enter an image name_, paste the following:
+
[.console-input]
[source,text]
----
quay.io/brancz/prometheus-example-app:v0.3.0
----
7. You can use anything in the box that says _Application Name_, but you
*must* put `metrics-app` in the box that says _Name_.
+
The _Name_ value is used as the base unique identifier applied to all of the
objects that end up deployed. For example, the `Deployment` will be called
`metrics-app`.
8. Leave all other values at their defaults and click _Create_.

### A Quick Prometheus Overview
Prometheus is a time-series database (TSDB) that stores key/value metrics and
provides access to them via a structured query language, PromQL. It also has
a framework that includes plug-ins which can talk to services to send alerts
(eg: Pagerduty, Slack, etc). Applications are expected to expose a `/metrics`
endpoint and provide data in a specific syntax, and Prometheus will scrape
this data and store it in the TSDB.

Application owners/developers are responsible for making sure that their
applications implement this `/metrics` endpoint, and the application that you
deployed in the previous example does just that.

In the _Developer_ perspective, in the _metrical_ `Project`, in the
_Topology_ view, you can click the little pop-out arrow to visit the
application. It was exposed via a `Route` when you deployed the container
image. This simple application will just provide a greeting.

Once you have a browser tab with the application open, add `/metrics` to the
end of the URL and hit Enter. You will then see the Prometheus metrics data
and it likely looks something like the following:

[source,text]
----
# HELP http_request_duration_seconds Duration of all HTTP requests
# TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{code="200",handler="found",method="get",le="0.005"} 2

It is up to your application developers to ensure that the metrics they want
to record are presented here. Many languages already have Prometheus
libraries available to make it convenient to expose metrics. It is also
possible to derive metrics, mathematically, from already recorded metrics.
We'll describe the details on that in a moment.

[NOTE]
====
When you visit `/` or `/metrics` with a browser, your browser also makes a
request for a favicon, which the app interprets as a normal HTTP GET request,
and this increments the HTTP request counter. If you use curl to visit the
app's endpoints, you would not see this "extra" increment. Visits to
`/metrics` don't normally increment the counters, but the request for the
favicon _does. You'll also notice that visiting `/` with your browser
increments the count by two - one for the request to the page and another
"hidden" request for the favicon.
====

Prometheus scrapes these special key/value data points and stores them in its
database. First, though, you have to tell Prometheus to actually look for
your applications.

### Creating a Service Monitor
Prometheus doesn't automatically find application metrics endpoints. It needs to be told where to look. This is done using an instance of a `ServiceMonitor`.

The following `ServiceMonitor` definition tells Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the application you just deployed:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: example-monitor
spec:
  endpoints:
  - interval: 30s
    port: 8080-tcp
    scheme: http
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: metrics-app
----

You'll notice that the `ServiceMonitor` is looking at endpoints of a
Kubernetes `Service`, and, in this case, specifically at the port named
`8080-tcp`. Prometheus will know to find all of the `Pods` that are a part of
this `Service` and scrape their endpoints. It will do this automatically, no
matter how big or small the `Deployment` is scaled.

1. Copy the above YAML to your clipboard
2. In the _Developer_ perspective, in your _metrical_ `Project`, click _+Add+_
3. Click _YAML_
4. Paste the `ServiceMonitor` YAML into the box
5. Click _Create_

The Prometheus for user workload monitoring will shortly detect this
`ServiceMonitor` and begin scraping the `/metrics` endpoint of the deployed
application.

### Viewing Application Metrics
Now that Prometheus is scraping the metrics, you can view the metrics in the
OpenShift web console.

1. Make sure you are in the _Developer_ perspective
2. Click _Monitoring_ in the left navigation
3. Click the _Metrics_ tab in the center area
4. Click _Select Query_ and then choose _Custom Query_
5. Type `http` into the box, and notice that a drop-down of options appears
+
If you recall the Prometheus metrics data from earlier when you visited the `/metrics` page, you'll see that these are all metrics that were displayed.
+
Choose `http_requests_total` and hit _Enter_
6. Set the graph to _15m_(inutes)

You should see a graph of the number of HTTP requests.

Open the application again (you might still have that browser tab handy) and
change the URL to end with `/err`. You will notice that the browser reports a
404 error (not found), but that's OK. The application is actually what is
responding with that 404, and the application is recording this as a
different HTTP request. Refresh the `/err` page a few times. Then go back to
the graph you were looking at.

In a few moments you should see a new colored line appear with the number of
404 requests that were recorded, and the table at the bottom will also update
with these details.

Feel free to visit `/` and `/err` and `/metrics` endpoints a few more times
to see the graphs change.

### Creating a Custom Alert
Creating custom alerts is just as simple as creating the monitor. Custom
alerts are defined using a `PrometheusRule` object. The following YAML
defines a `PrometheusRule` that will cause an alert to fire when the number
of `404` errors in the `http_requests_total` exceeds a quantity of 10:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: example-alert
spec:
  groups:
  - name: example
    rules:
    - alert: TooManyErrorAlert
      expr: http_requests_total{code="404"} > 10
----

1. Make sure you are in the _Developer_ perspective
2. Click _+Add_
3. Click _YAML_
4. Copy and paste the above `PrometheusRule` YAML into the box
5. Click _Create_

[WARNING]
====
With OpenShift 4.5, alerts are not yet exposed in the OpenShift web console,
even for administrators. Custom monitoring and alerting is a Tech Preview
feature. In the future, the alerts will move into the web console for both
admin and non-admin users. The following instructions are temporary until
OpenShift 4.6 is available.
====

### Triggering the Alert
Triggering the alert is simple. Visit the `/err` endpoint of the application
until you have exceeded more than 10 `404` codes. You can check how many
`404` you have either by viewing the `/metrics` endpoint, or by using the
metrics view in the OpenShift web console!

Once you have more than 10 `404` errors:

1. Switch to the _Administrator_ perspective at the upper left
2. Click _Monitoring_
3. Click _Alerting_
4. Click _Alertmanager UI_
5. Click _Log in with OpenShift_
6. Provide your cluster admin credentials
7. Click _Allow selected permissions_

You should see your alert listed.

[NOTE]
====
The above process for accessing Alertmanager is because OpenShift places an
OAuth proxy in front of Alertmanager. You are logging in (via the OAuth
proxy) and then granting permission to use your user credentials (via the
proxy). Alertmanager itself does not have any authentication, so placing it
behind the proxy and requiring `cluster-admin` credentials ensures that only
the right people can access it.
====

### Recording Rules
Earlier we mentioned that it was possible to perform mathematical
calculations on recorded metrics. This is done via a _Recording Rule_, which
is a component of a `PrometheusRule`. We won't do more than show a potential
example of a rule here:

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: example
    rules:
    - record: job:http_inprogress_requests:sum
      expr: sum by (job) (http_inprogress_requests)
----

This would calculate a sum of all `job` values in the `http_inprogress_requests` key. 

It is important for you and your developers to understand that _Recording
Rules_ can be expensive in terms of the calculation power they require.
Complex calculation expressions will consume Prometheus' horsepower, and it
is possible to cripple the monitoring infrastructure by writing too many
expensive/complicated recording rule expressions. Keep it simple.

More information on _Recording Rules_ is available in the
link:https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/rules/[Prometheus documentation.]

### Next Steps
As administrators of the OpenShift platform, there's not much else for you to
do besides enabling user-configured monitoring and alerting and configuring
the default permissions. If you want to familiarize yourself with
link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/[Prometheus'
query language], it could be helpful to work with your end users to assist
them in building monitoring and recording rules.
